Azure `_____` is a serverless solution that allows you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs. Instead of worrying about deploying and maintaining servers, the cloud infrastructure provides all the up-to-date resources needed to keep your applications running.

Azure **Functions** is a serverless solution that allows you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs. Instead of worrying about deploying and maintaining servers, the cloud infrastructure provides all the up-to-date resources needed to keep your applications running.

You focus on the code that matters most to you, in the most productive language for you, and Azure Functions handles

We often build systems to react to a series of critical `_____`. Whether you're building a web API, responding to database changes, processing IoT data streams, or even managing message queues - every application needs a way to run some code as these `_____` occur

We often build systems to react to a series of critical **events**. Whether you're building a web API, responding to database changes, processing IoT data streams, or even managing message queues - every application needs a way to run some code as these **events** occur

Azure Functions provides "`_____` on-demand"

%

Azure Functions provides "**compute** on-demand"

##

Azure Functions allows you to implement your system's logic into readily available blocks of code. These code blocks are called

%

"functions"

##

Different functions can run anytime you need to respond to critical

%

events

##

As requests increase, Azure Functions meets the demand with as many resources and function instances as necessary - but only while needed. As requests fall, any extra resources and application instances drop off

%

automatically

##

Azure Functions provides as many or as few compute resources as needed to meet your application's

%

demand

##

Providing compute resources on-demand is the essence of `_____` computing in Azure Functions.
