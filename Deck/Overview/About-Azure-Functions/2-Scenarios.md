The following are a common, but by no means exhaustive, set of scenarios for Azure Functions.

These scenarios allow you to build event-driven systems using modern architectural patterns.

- Process data in real time

##

With Azure Functions, if you want to
build a web API, then

%

Implement an endpoint for your web applications using the HTTP trigger

##

With Azure Functions, if you want to
process file uploads, then

%

Run code when a file is uploaded or changed in blob storage

##

With Azure Functions, if you want to
build a serverless workflow, then

%

Create an event-driven workflow from a series of functions using durable functions

##

With Azure Functions, if you want to
respond to database changes, then

%

Run custom logic when a document is created or updated in Azure Cosmos DB

##

With Azure Functions, if you want to
run scheduled tasks, then

%

Execute code on pre-defined timed intervals

##

With Azure Functions, if you want to
create reliable message queue systems, then

%

Process message queues using Queue Storage, Service Bus, or Event Hubs

##

With Azure Functions, if you want to
analyze IoT data streams, then

%

Collect and process data from IoT devices

##

With Azure Functions, if you want to
rrocess data in real time, then

%

Use Functions and SignalR to respond to data in the moment

As you build your functions, you have the following options and resources available:

- Use your preferred `_____`: Write functions in C#, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell, or Python, or use a custom handler to use virtually any other `_____`.
- Automate `_____`: From a tools-based approach to using external pipelines, there's a myriad of `_____` options available.
- Troubleshoot a function: Use monitoring tools and testing strategies to gain insights into your `_____`.
- Flexible pricing options: With the Consumption plan, you only pay while your functions are `_____`, while the Premium and App Service plans offer features for specialized needs.
